DESCRIPTION:
Odometer lets you measure and track statistics from your walk, run, or drive.


HOW TO USE IT:
Start - Starts tracking
Stop - Ends tracking and enters data in database
Menu | Clear List - Clears database


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
Odometer currently requires that it remains running to track your every turn.  
Future builds will use a Service to allow you to do other activities and return to see your statistics and record your run.
